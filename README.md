# Odd-Low-Pass-Filter
The Odd-Low-Pass Filter is a tool to remove smaller, odd-parity structures like the vertical waves, and use the filtered data to examine the location of the Galaxy's mid-plane.

# OLPF.py (or errorbar.py)
Contains all OLPF codes, the average vertical height (for each radial bin) calculated with vertical waves removed, and the error bars of that calculation.
