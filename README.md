# Odd-Low-Pass-Filter
The Odd-Low-Pass Filter is a tool to remove smaller, odd-parity structures like the vertical waves, and use the filtered data to examine the location of the Galaxy's mid-plane.

## OLPF.py (or errorbar.py)
A Python file that contains all OLPF codes, the average vertical height (for each radial bin) calculated with vertical waves removed, and the error bars of that calculation.

## Verlet Integration Simulation.py
A simulation using Verlet integration that plots the motion of stars in the vertical direction after every timestep.

## analysis without OLPF.py
A mid-plane analysis without OLPF.
